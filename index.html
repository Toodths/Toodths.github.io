    The four album covers above you can see are: Exmilitary(Death Grips), Ants from Up There(Black Country, New Road), Visions and Afterthoughts(Red Vox) 
    and Twin Fantasy(Car Seat Headrest). Unironically i would reccomend you to listen to all of them (apart from the Red Vox album because tbh its not a masterpiece, i just love it)
    because they are genuine masterpieces and think its devastating anyone could go though life and not hear one that they could have a chance to have fallen in love with like i did.
    Some other small reccomendation i would give would be "Wide Awake!" by Parquet Courts, "Hallelujah" by Igorrr, "Blood Visions" by Jay Reatard and "Cheat Codes" 
    by Black Thought + Danger Mouse. </h2>

      <p>Ants From Up There is an absolute masterpiece. The most beautiful and heart wrenching albums ive ever had the pleasure of listening to from start to finish with themes ranging from deeply emotive depressions, such as throughout “Haldern”, to extremely energetic highs, such as the chorus in “Chaos Space Marine”. The intro starts with an extremely effective saxophone riff that through the course of the short 54 second song has instruments slowed layer on top of one another. With the first instrument being a guitar slowly playing almost baiting you into a sense of relaxation before a wave of drums and more riffs are layered on at once instantly whiplashing you into an energetic crescendo before ending abruptly. This opening song, “Intro” , while short, sets the album up perfectly representing both the slow and depressing thematic lows and the energetic and lively highs.<br>
        This song is then followed by one of the biggest earworms of the album with “Chaos Space Marine”. “Chaos Space Marine” is also the song that first introduces Black Country, New Roads former vocalist Isaac Wood, one of the most charismatic and emotive vocalists I’ve ever heard. After the songs opening with sporadic instruments a piano comes in setting up an extremely catchy backing for the track. This happens along side the introduction of the bands vocalist with an instantly drawn and tired delivery fitting perfectly with the piano almost conveying the effortless matching with the tune. This is a reoccurring theme throughout the album in which the vocals are often delivered in a very melancholic way which both builds this somber feeling with the listener with a level of hope behind the vocals that really enable the highs of the album. This is well portrayed on this song with the beginning being quite a gloomy delivery, which only makes it more powerful when the songs hits its chorus in which the vocals become more and more lively, uplifting the listener. This along side the instrumentals amazing build into the chorus is a combo for an amazing and catchy chorus.<br>
       This is followed up by the “Concorde” in which the guitars truly shine in creating a wistful yet enthusiastic backing. This paired with a very emotional delivery of lyrics from the vocalist causes the song to feel almost as if you are floating along during the listening of it. Yet another reoccurring genius of this album is shown on this song which is the long and emotional builds powerful and animated chorus’s. This is best displayed at the last build towards the latter end of the song in which the instrumentals and vocals slowly increase in vigor until the penultimate borderline yell of the vocalist letting you get lost in the upbeat high of the song.<br>
       Bread song following is just simply a masterclass in story telling and emotive vocalisation. Even not knowing what the lyrics are about, the portrayal of pure emotion comes through on this song with moving instrumental only reinforcing this and getting you truly lost within the music. The song eventually switches to fairly upbeat instrumentals backing the vocals switching the theme of the song from blue to optimistic and lifting. This causes a feeling of buoyancy as the listener is lifted from this pit of sadness to a much more confident sense along with the vocalist.<br>
       “Good Will Hunting” is begun with a increasing soaring synth foreshadowing almost a literal elevation of the themes in the song from the previous moody low to a an instantly more cheerful beat. This is only reinforced once some extremely catchy drums are introduced along with backing vocals that give a sense of confidence to the vocals pairing with the listeners newfound enthusiastic feeling with rosy instrumentals. Throughout this song the vocals and instrumentals get more cheerful. This reaches it peak in the second half of the song in which crashing sambals and drums along with energetic vocals uplift the listener into this sense of bliss. This bliss however is quickly turned from a high and mighty feeling, to a much more relaxed feeling with the abrupt and to “Good Will Hunting” followed by “Haldern”, a very slow beginning to a song in which there are only small builds initially with much quieter vocals almost producing this feeling of being defeated. Despite this the song slowly gains bigger and bigger builds throughout its runtime almost generating a building sense of confidence. Up till this point the ups and downs of the vocalists performances effectively emotionally invests the listener in the story of the singer and so making these builds in confidence all that much more rewarding to hear.<br>
       This is followed by one of the most lugubrious songs on the albums, “Marks Theme”, which begins with a relatively simple saxophone solo until a piano begins to join and the song is instantly imbued with a newfound feeling of hope and happiness yet with a melancholic feeling of longing as the instrumental continually recesses into mournful silences. This is made even more emotional once the context is known that the song is a tribute to the saxophonist’s uncle who passed away. Explaining why the saxophone solo was saturated with so much emotion and melancholy.<br>
       This transitions into my personal favorite song on the album, “The Place Where He Inserted the Blade”. It begins with a beautiful piano and flute followed by the gorgeous delivery of the vocalist sounding crushed and longing yet hopeful. This hope is built upon from the start reaching a much more elated feeling. This develops into the chorus in which both the instrumentals and vocals are intensely enthusiastic yet morose. Despite the instrumentals relaxing after the chorus, the vocal delivery of lines does not and is still permeates the newfound confidence building yet again into another magnificent chorus with a choir of backing vocals and stunning saxophone really entrenching this feeling evoked by the of bold and dauntless singing. The song then slows to a gradual and slow end almost bittersweet due to how upbeat the runtime of the song is.<br>
       The continual bombardment with emotional turmoil throughout the album does not end with the next song “Snow Globes” beginning with gracious instrumentals that evoke more encouraging feelings in the listener than the instrumentals on a song like “Haldern”. Drums are then introduced far in the background of the song slowly being brought forward displaying the genius behind the development of the songs on the albums. Vocals are then later introduced with a sense of lingering sadness yet still feel reassuring as the song slowly builds with fast simbal’s + drums being introduced again lifting the song slowly but surely. This stirring drumming gradually increases to loud frantic drumming in which vocals are then shouted over establishing the sense of the tireless attempts by the singer to escape the depressing hole of emotion he has being trying to escape from throughout each song on the album. Towards the end of the song the instrumentals are then reduced to simple the same simple and gracious repeating instrumentals heard at the beginning of the song which create this feeling that no matter how many times the singer reaches the highs of emotion they will continually return to the same state of melancholic sadness.<br>
       The final song on the album, “Basketball Shoes” has the longest runtime on the album at a lengthy 12 minutes and 37 seconds. Once again it begins with a gradual build with vocals being introduced sounding broken. Despite this as seen before the music and vocals get progressively more energetic until once again as seen so many times on the album the build reduces to the same blue and moody instrumentals. This leads the listener into the same place as previously on the album expecting a saddening ending to the confidence of the vocals and a depressing end, however the instrumentals, instead of fading to silence, quickly increase faster and faster until switching to an extremely cheery beat. The vocals reintroduced sound new and rejuvenated. Quickly transitioning to energetic shouting vocals and fast lively vocals. Until for one more time quickly being tampered down into a quiet muffled tune sounding almost only just struggling to stay alive on the track. The expectation of a depressing end to the song however is yet again quickly subverted into an extremely loud and abrasive guitar with all instrumentals being introduced at once. This time rather than a gradual build an instant punch of energy absorbs the song slowing and slowing, however this time, rather than dampening down to muffled instruments, loud harsh drums keep the heartbeat of the song going, the vocals quickly latching onto this energy and very quickly building into this larger than life swing with every instrument playing and vocals screaming with one of the most stunning emotional vocal and instrumental performances I’ve ever heard in my life. This energy is kept up with some of the most jubilant sound vocals on the album so far. This confident vocal performance only enhances the listeners’ feeling of being absorbed in exquisite power and rather than tampering out to nothingness this high is the only on the album to end with an exceptional amount of energy and power. This end indicates an almost completion to the vocals constant attempt to get out of this pit of repeating depressive lows as this final song finally ended with aggressive confidence concluding the albums theme and giving the most satisfying ends to an album I’ve ever heard.</p>

      <summary><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0084;">Exmilitary</span> - Death Grips <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: small; color: #d66102;">10/10</span></summary>
      <p>Exmilitary is an album that heavily influenced in quality by Rides astonishing vocal performance and i cannot stress enough that throughout every song on the album Ride perfectly establishes the feeling of fear and dread throughout. A lot of my love for the album comes from the lyrics however not only would it take me ages to go over the lyrics that i like it would also be a waste because literally anyone can search up genius.com and find much better analysis into the meaning of Rides vocals. <br>
        Exmilitary begins with Beware, what i would are is the best opening I’ve ever heard on an album in my life. This song starts with a sample from a speech by ex-cult leader Charles Manson. Already this sets up the themes for the album being unwavering in discussing and using grim imagery to get across a point. The speech also perfectly encompasses the albums ideologically anarchic themes. Its basically an absolutely genius sample to use at the start of the album setting it up perfectly. The guitar riff in the backing is also not only iconic and easily recognisable, its simplicity does not cripple its ability to instill a feeling of dread in the listener. This short exert is then immediately followed up by a soaring yells and a fast tapping drums along with slow heavy drum beat. This is the perfect set up for the vocalists, MC Ride, introduction. Starting right off the bat with some of my favourite bars on the album, specifically “i am the beast i worship” which is basically the sentiment this album is infused with throughout. The extraordinary instrumentals manage to make this an extremely catchy song despite being quite hardcore and yelling. The song will also sometimes come to very short silences before following up by hitting you in the face with instrumentals again. Almost representing the audio incarnation of Rides lyrics about “beating” something. With each stop and reintroduction of instrumentals being like each punch. There is also the very notable lyric here of “to pray is to accept defeat”, with its cynical atheism fitting perfectly with the themes of the album.<br>
         The second song, Guillotine, not only does it have one of the most memorable refrains of all time “it goes it goes it goes it goes, YUH” with a mixture of deep and rumbling bass combined with soaring synths being a recipe for fear. The song also being called and sampling a guillotine also evokes the concept of a guillotine which was not purely used for any killing but used historically in france to execute the monarchy. This link is unlikely to be coincidence with the albums exploration of outright rejecting authority which would include that or monarchs. <br>
        Spread Eagle Across the Block starts with a sample and spliced vocals instantly producing a haunting feel to the song. This is instantly followed up on with Rides absolutely brutal vocals. The instrumentals on this song while alone probably being a fairly upbeat tune are have distorted guitars and exaggerated certain parts that twist it from upbeat to having an unnerving undertone. <br>
        Lord of the Game throughout uses fast and franticly repeating short vocal samples. The way this is used along side fast drumming and Rides vocals work immensely well together. The fact that vocal samples are used almost like an instrument on this song are also linked to the themes of fear throughout the album with the association of a human voice being used to create such a haunting song. The fact that during the chorus of the song Rides lyrics ask questions that are instantly answered by the backing vocals accelerates the song to new heights of speed as it gives the feeling of not even being capable to know what the question was before it is answered and instantly moved on from. This idea of turning rhetorical questions into answered ones is a genius way to give the illusion of the song speeding up in pace. <br>
        Takyon (Death Yon) follows this with some instant vocal splices to form a distorted version of the word takyon. This along side some hauntingly deep synths formatting the perfect introduction to the song. Takyon has probably got Rides best flow on it with the iconic chorus being likely the best known on the album. The name and repeated word Takyon on this song is almost certainly referring to the Tachyon particle that theoretically goes faster than lights. I predict this is purely a reinforcement of the albums fast and abrasive undertones with the tachyon almost being the physical representation of the chaotic ideology the album explores. The song also includes many repeated samples of Rides lyrics almost create a glitching effect. This evokes in the listener the idea of the song being so chaotic and fast that even the vocalist is struggling to stay stable. This effect is reoccurring throughout the album i believe for the same reasons. <br>
        The Cut Throat (instrumental) interlude i believe serves as a place for the listener to catch their breath while still keeping tensions and  the haunting attitude of the album so far. I also think this song creates a sense of dread rather than fear like the previous songs did allowing for a setup for the second half of the album in way that does not dampen the themes up until this point. <br>
        This interlude is then followed by Klink a song on the abuses of police showing how truly ahead if their time they where critiquing the criminal justice system years before movements like BLM where ever large. These themes of criticising the police fit also perfectly with the anti-authority message imbued throughout the album. There is also this brutal electric guitar during the chorus that makes the song course with energy.  The drums this song going crazy hard.<br>
         Culture Shock following with the theme behind culture shock yet again relating to speed as it relates to culture changing at a rate somebody cannot keep up with. There is also this repeating distorted vocal sample repeating throughout formulating fear in the listener as aggressive vocals are shouted over the song. 
        5D is yet another interlude that relates the the song before Culture Shock relating to the fact that culture and technology progresses at a rate to hard to keep track of, this idea is continued into 5D with weird electronic samples and synths being used to represent being transported somewhere we have never been to, quite literally culture and future shock with us having little idea what is happening. <br>
        The listener is then whiplashed out of this interlude with Thru the Walls that starts with a blaring airhorn and repeatedly charging synths. They also sample a piece from an old internet meme/video that i hold very close to me due to hearing it be used many times throughout my childhood. Ride instantly comes in to match the energy of blaring electronics and frantic drumming instilling pure fear in the listener. This extremely catchy chorus with the very fun reframe “kill it” that again just entrenches the morbid topics and instrumentals of the album.<br>
        Following this is Known for It, a song that has background synths that sound almost like hissing snakes instilling a feeling of paranoia followed by a later electric guitar doing a riff that sounds like it belongs in a horror movie. <br>
        Following this song is I Want It I Need It (Death Heated). The duration of this song in laced with this sharp and fast drum tapping setting up a perfect framework for Rides flow to really shine on this song. Ride also has some pretty raw refrains on this song with the repeated “bitch” done in a much more raw and desperate tone in which his voice is cracking and straining purely layering on the ominous feel. <br>
        Next up on the lineup is Blood Creepin begining with Rides stirring yells and shouts. Something that you will notice in this song is there will be occatiobal breaks to the abrasive drumming and vocals for this very short and catchy electronic riff. This only makes keeps the energy of the song up while still making it unbelievably catchy and powerful. The slow nature of this short riff also makes for a pretty eerie backing. </p>

      <summary><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0084;">Twin Fantasy</span> - Car Seat Headrest <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: small; color: #d66102;">10/10</span></summary>
      <p>The first song, My Boy - Twin Fantasy, begins with a short and simple guitar riff with a repressed and emotional vocals overlayed getting higher and higher pitched as the more instruments are introduced. i also love how the high pitched vocals make it sound almost like the vocalist is on the verge of crying and so when they switch slightly to a lower pitched confidence it almost is the audio representation of someone trying to pull themself together. This is also shown by the music becoming much heavy with drums and backing vocals being introduced. This perfectly represents the rest of the albums rapid oscillation between extremely depressing low themes and high exciting peaks.<br>
        this song begins with one of the most recognisable and catchy guitar riffs on the album with along with the song developing fast and frantic drumming, this is until the vocals kick in almost giving them a sort of blissful feeling as the song transforms from a frantic and chaotic instrumentals to much more relaxed instrumental interludes and vocals. This is then subverted again as a tidal wave of instrumentals hit you with vocals increasing to a borderline scream. The juxtaposition between the previously relaxed vocals to the energetic and loud ones one makes the effectiveness of this increased energy in the instrumentals all that much more powerful. This trend ends at a point in which the instrumentals suddenly stop with the vocals slowing to almost a chant like rhythm in which each syllable is interjected with a guitar making each one of the 7 so much more impactful, this means that despite the slow down in instrumentals, the song instantly kicks off of this small interlude with even more energy that previously. This is something ive only ever seen with this song in which it cleverly develops energetic highs in the song not by gradual build ups but with fast, punchy and catchy interludes. Getting to the halfway mark of the song the vocals and instrumentals slow down eventually coming to a comparitively much more tame song with only guitars, vocals and relaxed drums. This point in the song is almost letting you catch your breath after. This is extreamly effective at making the song feel so floaty to listen to as comparatively it feels like welcoming comforting instrumentals. The song however keeps you on your toes numerous times slowing to an almost silence before whiplashing you with heavy drums and vocals. This constant back and fourth between relaxing and energy means that the song almost never gets boring for me due to it not being just a constant bombardment of music but rather being a meticulous mixture of emotional up and downs. Due to this the song is able to gradually develop the energy without the listener even knowing with certain points just beyond the middle of the song being much less frantic and fast than the beginning of the song yet just as layered and animated. The song comes to a short silence before once again beginning with the same instrumentals as the start of the song. However this time rather than long depressive vocals it is much more lively and confident vocals. Perfectly displaying how this song impressively developed energy throughout the course of the track despite numerous very chilled moments in the song. The newer confident vocals come along with this sense of newfound power. This brings the listener almost in a sense above the clouds in which the energy in this section of the song sounds much more gentile than the abrasive sense at the beginning of the song.<br>
        Stop Smoking (We Love You) is a beautiful song consisting mainly of so absolutely amazing vocals and a acoustic guitar. This much simpler and shorter formula allows for much more of an emotive performance as there is little else to listen to other than the vocals and singing working in tandem to create a much more relaxing and chilled song. This again in a sense works as a place to take a breath on the album before it continues on to Sober to Death.<br>
        Sober to Death has one of the most effective chorus's on the album for me with each instrument seeming to soar along side the vocals effortlessly, working together seamlessly. Also i love the fact that the lyrics actually imply the reason for the soaring yelling vocals rather than doing it purely because it sounded nice. This song really lets guitars shine with short riffs interludes and sudden repeating notes that emphasis the importance of certain faster lyrics while letting the song relax during much slower paced points. Making it so this song almost never gets to become nagging. <br>
        Nervous Young Inhumans has some extremely effective repeating musical interludes in between vocal performances. This is gradually reduced to some very quiet drumming and guitars to the point where the vocalist is basically casually talking over them. This is where i would argue the vocalists skill really shines that still gives in extremely emotive performance yet sounding so uncaring at the same time. This gives the feeling of a very genuine vocal performance, making the feeling it emotes all that much more real to the listener. The instrumentals during this section still do not become boring or drag with them staying dynamic and fun even over depressed vocals.<br>
        Bodys is instantly a very energetic song being contrasted against the much more down low ending to the previous track. This track again tampers down at a point to near only vocals basically to a walk before spring back into a sprint with a wave of louder vocals that seemingly pick the depressive vocals up and elevate them to feeling subsequently much more confident and lively. This same pattern happens yet again later on in the song keeping up the energy and with the vocals compared to the beginning of the song sounding significantly more cheerful lifting the listeners emotions along side the vocalists. <br>
        Cute Thing utilises a similar strategy however is much more dynamic in which it will decrease and increase the energy relatively fast making for a rollercoaster of emotions, only reinforced by the vocalists astounding ability to convey such strong emotions to the listener through this sort of grassroots and genuine singing style. The vocal style perfectly combos with the very loud yet meticulous instrumental performances on the track. <br>
        High to Death is a much more melancholic song giving a different musical take on the previous song Stop Smoking (We Love You) at points including samples of a child yelling all that much more adding to this melancholic feeling of looking back. The depressed vocals and much more relaxed instruments only add to this theme with distorted synths throughout the song and distorted vocal samples.<br>
        Famous Prophets (Stars) is a continuation of this melancholy however over the course of the song there is slow development towards much more confident vocal and instrumental performance. This song also has one of the most memorable bass riffs that perfectly encompasses the feeling of pure bliss with the song gradually building layers of instruments and louder vocals repeating the same phrase until another layer of more energetic vocals are introduced which work elegantly with the backing vocals and somehow sound full without sounding messy. The music is then reduced to purely vocals and piano, an absolutely beautiful performance and is astoundingly good at just evoking the feeling of longing and melancholy. This feeling continues dampening the mood until the last stretch of the song when it rapidly transforms from when all the instruments kick back in and soaring yells fill the listener with rejuvenated energy. This ends the song on a much more energised and cheery note.<br>
        This happy note left off in Famous Prophets (Stars) is continued in the following song Twin Fantasy (Those Boys) which begins with some rosy synths and some fairly upbeat vocals to accompany this. Drums throughout this song are used to set up and enhance vocal reframes which works immensely well to say the least. This song could easily be interpreted as the highest and most cheerful point in the album however this makes it an extremely bittersweet ending. Car Seat Headrest even leans into this idea with short  vocal interludes towards in the song breaking the fourth wall and reflecting on the song. This however is quickly broken up by a gradual lead into a heavy break of all instruments absorbing the listener one last time before ending abruptly. The album as a whole is an emotional rollercoaster making this ending truly one of the most bittersweet and melancholic endings to a song/album i’ve ever heard. Concluding the album perfectly and bringing it to the best close there could possibly be for such a dynamic album, i would expect nothing less than a dynamic and almost cliffhanger of an ending. It really makes the album stay with you for a long time.<br>

      <p>Total Football on this album serves as an extremely catchy opener with a heavy guitar and drums, both or which that speed up setting up the stage up for the bands extraordinarily charismatic vocalist, Andrew Savage. Throughout this song the top level of guitars very a lot in riffs allowing for a dynamic performance with one of the catchiest riffs on the albums being in Total Football’s chorus. There are also short sections in which vocals are broken up short instrumental silences making each and every one all that much more punchy. The lyrics on this song also explore the ideological implications behind collectivist societies describing all kinds of jobs and workers saying that “power, resembled, if we are assembled” clearly referring to the idea that the way workers are able to get their voices heard is through collective action. This is reinforced by the line following a similar setup arguing workers are “better protected, whenever collected”. This theme throughout the song of collective action is also linked to the line “Only through those, who stay awake, can an institution be dismantled. It is dishonest, nay a sin, to stand for any anthem that attempts to drown out the roar of oppression”. wow this is a good verse. The first half clearly refers to the idea of staying awake to being woke. A term coined linking to the idea of racial injustice however over the years has transformed into a umbrella term describing many progressive lines of thinking. This bar therefore stating that an institution, weather it be capitalism, the criminal justice system or just the status quo generally, can only be dismantled through this progressive way of thinking about the collective condition of workers. This is an extremely clever way to almost explain class consciousness to the listener without it coming across as preachy. The following line is a obvious jab at national anthems and a countries audacity to ask for the people to stand up for it, as for america, meanwhile economically or racially oppressing them. One of the closing lines stating “Collectivism and autonomy are not mutually exclusive” clearly disregarding a counter view that the collectivisation of individuals must imply the destruction of individuality and that they are in fact not mutually exclusive ideological grounds to fight for. The vocalists yelling and straining performance across the album almost comes across to the lister as a kind of rallying cry with such power and energy that you cant help but listen intently to the lyrical content of the album. <br>
      The next song, Violence through its duration has numerous burst of fast frantic drumming that really helps get across the powerful but desperate delivery from the vocalist. There are also these soaring synths in throughout creating quite a haunting atmosphere to the song. One of my favourite lines this song “you protect no one by obscuring the mirror that reflects our own problematic reality” making reference to peoples unwillingness to acknowledge or even going as far to hide the reality of oppressive systems such as capitalism or the criminal justice system. “Riot is an unfinished grave that dug to deposit up depleted anger… it is a word to use to delegitimise your unrest, and to make your resistance an overreaction” These lyrics are exploring how cultural implications behind the term “Riot” and how it is used have been used historically to undermine the efforts of cultural unrest by labelling a group of justifiably angry citizens as a riot. <br>
      Before the Water Gets Too High is a song that utilises backing synths and high reverb guitars to create a really lucid feeling, almost as if to be floating. This works perfectly with the songs theme of the sea and rising water levels. “If the clock strikes midnight then, what becomes of our demonstrations? To which fate have these gatherings fell? Which walls echo all the chants we yelled” I love this bar so much. Its idea of the clock striking midnight representing the breaking point for complete doom like the doomsday clock, followed by the vocalists questioning of what it was all for in that situation. The idea of walls echoing with the chants they yelled being a suggestion that the movement has failed and that there is no one that remains, leaving only echos of those passed. This is the vocalist questioning peoples ability to truly sway governments and officials to take action on the impacts of the climate before the clock strikes midnight and there are only echos left. The vocalist, Savage, also uses the phrase “glass barely bends before it cracks” being the perfect metaphors for how fragile nature and the world is to natural climate disaster. He also explains that “Time cant be bought, by the profits that you make” this critiquing both multinational corporation’s and politicians willingness to destroy the climate for bribes and profits despite the fact that the effect of this could be the morbid reality of a ticking down to their own deaths. And no matter how much money they make, they are incapable of stopping this ticking until its too late. He also uses the line “or is it something else before, until the rich are refugees” to convey that he climate crisis is left to other people by the rich due to them being the last to be directly drastically impacted by the effects of it. <br>
      The next song Mardi Gras Beads has much more repressed and emotional vocals, this combined with more relaxing drums yet the song still has some hard hitting and artistic guitars. Good god this bands guitars are good. This along with the really beautiful lyrics evoke such a mesmerising feeling. <br>
      Almost Had to Start a Fight/In and Out of Patience begins with these four repeated drum and guitar notes that are loud and abrasive setting up Savages shouting repeating “Almost”, this is a reoccurring theme in the song where a repeated shouted words is in tune with the repeated musical phrases and it workss so well. The song then suddenly slows to a bridging segment in which the instrumentals switch up to a much more funky beat with the vocalist seamlessly switching to fit the song. The bridge used to get to this point has numerous silences in it making the lyrics so much more impactful and the sudden switch so much more jarring yet welcome. <br>
      The funk continues on the album with Freebird II with its name obviously indicating a commentary on the Vietnam war. The song also involves some very similar instrumentation to Freebird with similar guitars and vocal confidence. This however acts as much more of a critique of the aftermath of the war with the song ending with the very sarcastic phrase “Free, i feel free like you promised id be” repeated.<br>
      The song Normalisation instantly takes on a very loud and fast pace reflecting the vocalists clearly very angry delivery. <br>
      Back to Earth is a much more layed back and depressed song compared to Normalisation, taking on a melancholic attitude with the reverb added to the vocals emitting a feeling of longing<br>
      Wide Awake follows with one of the catchiest beats and catchphrases on the whole album with the repeated “Im wide awake!” and christ the guitar riff is so catchyyy. I love this song irrationally. They then use some whistles for god knows what reason and it sounds so good. Which football referee did they bring into the studio to do that. Thats about it but its short, punchy and so instrumentally effective. <br>
      This is yet another really addicting beat that works so well with each burst of vocals, in this song they state “But you never listened to the music did ya? Talked so loud you dont hear other peoples problems. Trying to look like your not the person to solve them” this could be a jab at the people that will listen to music and refuse to consider the social commentary behind it, in this case with many people listening to the songs on the album yet refusing to actually consider the lyrics being said and issues discussed. <br>
      Extinction is a song that reminds me heavily of surfer rock with fast guitar that is very easy to listen to and has a very clear driving beat behind the song. <br>
      Death Will Bring Change, the much slower instrumentals and depressive vocals makes for a much more emotive song evoking a sad yet hopeful sense. This is one of the really whimsical songs on the album being just as beautiful as it is simple. <br>
      Finally the song, Tenderness, instantly back to a much more upbeat song, i can not tell you how well the piano in this song works drums and vocals. His vocals getting to a yell as the piano is introduced to match its energy in the chorus. The tambourines introduced while initially seeming small add a crazy amount to the song, with each song on the album it really is just the small this like that which all come together to make up such an earworm of an album, truly showing how magnificent the songwriting is throughout its duration.

      <p>Bangers vs. Fuckers is an absolute experience of an album from start to finish. It is some of the most brutal and raw instrumentation Ive ever heard and truly is garage rock boiled down to its purest form in my eyes. Loud coarse yelling into an over compressed microphone barely able to hear the vocals over some of the most abrasive guitars I’ve ever heard. From start to finish this album is loud and, in your face, never giving the listener a place to catch a breath, strangling them with the overwhelming screeching guitar riffs, my favourite of which being on ‘I Knew Her, She Knew Me’, and constant bombarding drums. With the only exception being the final song. None of this takes away from how catchy each and every song manages to be, a completely primal audio experience yet a stunningly fun one too.<br>
        This album is also a complete rejection of the power pop era and fully embraces the deafening and crushing side of rock while still managing to have some really catchy hooks such as on ‘You Gonna Get It’, ‘I Drank What?’ and ‘Extinguish Me’. Instruments being dispersed across the mix sporadically completely seizing the chaos it creates. The way they are dispersed almost completely absorbs you into the music and its almost nihilistic disregard for traditional song structure with the continual onslaught of drumming.<br>
        The consistency of the album to lean into the anarchy is what makes this album so consistently fun to listen to. It doesn’t care that the instrumentals are on the boarder of disarray. Not to say these instrumental performances are not amazing however with the drums and guitar riffs working insanely well together, as in all the musical disorder, there is a great deal of meticulous song writing. The final song really displaying this with a really upbeat backing drums and some backing vocals, with soaring electric guitars being used, what was previously being used to create lawlessness, is not being used to create a really comforting and flowing backing for the final send off track.

      <summary><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #ff0084;">Hellfire</span> - black midi <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: small; color: #d66102;">9/10</span></summary>
      <p>Hellfire that shines due to how well Black Midi does at monologging while not effecting the flow of the song and keeping it quite alternative and dynamic. This is perfectly displayed on the song in which the vocalist, Geordie Greep, can perfectly flow over the song despite some really abrasive drums that would traditionally be really hard to match. The reason Greep can do this so effectively is due to his insanely saturated and drawn voice that matches the frantic energy of the songs on the album. <br>
        Sugar/Tzu is a song that really does shine on the album with its fast pace that begins with a relatively slow and relaxed instrumentation and vocals until drums quickly lead into i faster pace and horns enter the instrument mix. This varied instruments are really what make Black Midi stand out for me as a see few people be as interesting a varied with how they use their instruments with horn sections in this song even sounding jazzy. Not to mention the ending of this song is a masterpiece with my favourite song transition of all time from Suger/Tzu to Eat Men Eat. The song going from extremely fast drumming to a short guitar solo and drums coming back in building up and up into what you would expect to be another chorus but instead leading seamlessly into the hard hitting sudden start of Eat Men Eat. This transition is shockingly good and goes so unbelievably hard i often listen to Sugar/Tzu solely to hear the end. <br>
        The energy from the first bar on Eat Men Eat is kept up throughout the song with the guitar however quickly slowing to a much more relaxed and quieter guitar and softer vocals. The drums however slowly build the song up only to yet again cool it down, this quickly ramps up though as the vocalists words are tapered of with strings.  Instantly being reintroduced with much more energy along with heavier drums. This time it does lead to a very fast and abrasive drums with the vocalist following with a screamed performance. The song also ends on a single not from a ton of instruments which sounds so good. <br>
        Welcome to Hell is one of the songs on the album that no matter how many times i listen to it is always just as catchy as the first. It has so many really really catchy guitar riffs throughout. Not to mention an amazing drum break around the 2:20 mark broken up by 2 sections of heavy electric guitars only to finish the break with such a powerful swing into the rest of the song. This one break really shows the power of drums in a song with the ability to bring so much life and energy into the song because that one short section gives so much more to the momentum of the song afterwords, i’ve listened to it so many times and it gets not less genius with each listen. The song does not let this energy go in vein though with a horn section that sounds almost haunting before rapidly increasing in pace. <br>
        Still is a bit of a return to the much more relaxing beginning of Eat Men Eat with just some beautiful sax playing in the background and some really emotional vocal performances. The horns in the background of this song really are the groundwork of this song holding everything up with such confidence. The song the temporary transforms into a really catchy guitar until slowly building to some heavy drums that you really feel in the song. Black Midi is truly just make instruments feel alive. The song returns to similarly relaxing beginnings towards the latter half with some really beautiful ambience and whatever that flute thing is, i think its a flute at least. Just really transporting the listener to another world. <br>
        Half Time is a short song that uses a radio station like interlude to set up the listener for the next half of the album and justifying the instant and sudden end to such a nice relaxing song. Not to mention ANOTHER amazing transition from Half Time to The Race Is About To Begin, i havent heard more seamless transitions apart from maybe In the Aeroplane Over the Sea by Neutral Milk Hotel.<br>
        The Race Is About To Begin is a song that just really lets Greep shine on the vocals with the constant bombardment of lyrics making for such an impressive vocal performance. The instrumentals sounding like they almost struggle to keep up with his frantic yelling. A section of extremely fast vocals being ended with so much energy and power despite already having so much, i dont know how the hell he does it. Singing then slowing to walk relaxing the song with some really astounding guitar work and soaring strings in the background forming a floaty atmosphere. <br>
        I love the last 3 songs for very similar reason which is their meticulous build throughout its duration up to a larger than life full instrumental swing. Also include some of the most emotive singing we’ve heard from Greep on the album up until this point with him sounding amazing on The Defence.

      <p>This EP is truly one of my personal favourites after hearing the first song i instantly fell in love with it. This is by far one of my favourite pieces of shoegaze to come out in recent years maybe second to Census Designate. The EP is so simple yet so effective at creating an atmosphere in every song. This is perfectly shown by the three first songs that begin in a repressed and melancholic fashion before bursting into colour sweeping the listener off their feet and transporting them to a world of bliss. Its just such a beautiful album and there is just something about the vocals that manage to bring me to borderline tears with each listen. Soaring guitars and synths making for such graceful yet decorated songs that are both simple and relaxing yet dynamic and radiant. The whole album emanating such a comforting aesthetic. Even in cases such as on ‘Alive, Always’ where pretty heavy and crunchy guitars are introduced, it still sounds so graceful with the juxtaposition somehow making the song more comforting especially for me due to how much i use white noise to drown out environments and sleep, i associate really crunchy deep noise with relaxation and comfort. Listening to this EP just engulfs me in calm and wards of anxiety so well. Perhaps the fact i listen to this to cool down from stress is a reason i associate it so strongly with unwinding, or its just the inherent magic of the album. Today I Lied Down always especially having some sort of audio remedial quality. If i ever need to escape reality for 20 minutes, this is the album that i will go back to time and time again.
