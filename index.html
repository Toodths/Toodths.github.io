    The four album covers above you can see are: Exmilitary(Death Grips), Ants from Up There(Black Country, New Road), Visions and Afterthoughts(Red Vox) 
    and Twin Fantasy(Car Seat Headrest). Unironically i would reccomend you to listen to all of them (apart from the Red Vox album because tbh its not a masterpiece, i just love it)
    because they are genuine masterpieces and think its devastating anyone could go though life and not hear one that they could have a chance to have fallen in love with like i did.
    Some other small reccomendation i would give would be "Wide Awake!" by Parquet Courts, "Hallelujah" by Igorrr, "Blood Visions" by Jay Reatard and "Cheat Codes" 
    by Black Thought + Danger Mouse. </h2>

      <summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ants From Up There</span> - Black Country, New Road</summary>
      <p>Ants From Up There is an absolute masterpiece. The most beautiful and heart wrenching albums ive ever had the pleasure of listening to from start to finish with themes ranging from deeply emotive depressions, such as throughout “Haldern”, to extremely energetic highs, such as the chorus in “Chaos Space Marine”. The intro starts with an extremely effective saxophone riff that through the course of the short 54 second song has instruments slowed layer on top of one another. With the first instrument being a guitar slowly playing almost baiting you into a sense of relaxation before a wave of drums and more riffs are layered on at once instantly whiplashing you into an energetic crescendo before ending abruptly. This opening song, “Intro” , while short, sets the album up perfectly representing both the slow and depressing thematic lows and the energetic and lively highs. This song is then followed by one of the biggest earworms of the album with “Chaos Space Marine”. “Chaos Space Marine” is also the song that first introduces Black Country, New Roads former vocalist Isaac Wood, one of the most charismatic and emotive vocalists I’ve ever heard. After the songs opening with sporadic instruments a piano comes in setting up an extremely catchy backing for the track. This happens along side the introduction of the bands vocalist with an instantly drawn and tired delivery fitting perfectly with the piano almost conveying the effortless matching with the tune. This is a reoccurring theme throughout the album in which the vocals are often delivered in a very melancholic way which both builds this somber feeling with the listener with a level of hope behind the vocals that really enable the highs of the album. This is well portrayed on this song with the beginning being quite a gloomy delivery, which only makes it more powerful when the songs hits its chorus in which the vocals become more and more lively, uplifting the listener. This along side the instrumentals amazing build into the chorus is a combo for an amazing and catchy chorus. This is followed up by the “Concorde” in which the guitars truly shine in creating a wistful yet enthusiastic backing. This paired with a very emotional delivery of lyrics from the vocalist causes the song to feel almost as if you are floating along during the listening of it. Yet another reoccurring genius of this album is shown on this song which is the long and emotional builds powerful and animated chorus’s. This is best displayed at the last build towards the latter end of the song in which the instrumentals and vocals slowly increase in vigor until the penultimate borderline yell of the vocalist letting you get lost in the upbeat high of the song. Bread song following is just simply a masterclass in story telling and emotive vocalisation. Even not knowing what the lyrics are about, the portrayal of pure emotion comes through on this song with moving instrumental only reinforcing this and getting you truly lost within the music. The song eventually switches to fairly upbeat instrumentals backing the vocals switching the theme of the song from blue to optimistic and lifting. This causes a feeling of buoyancy as the listener is lifted from this pit of sadness to a much more confident sense along with the vocalist. “Good Will Hunting” is begun with a increasing soaring synth foreshadowing almost a literal elevation of the themes in the song from the previous moody low to a an instantly more cheerful beat. This is only reinforced once some extremely catchy drums are introduced along with backing vocals that give a sense of confidence to the vocals pairing with the listeners newfound enthusiastic feeling with rosy instrumentals. Throughout this song the vocals and instrumentals get more cheerful. This reaches it peak in the second half of the song in which crashing sambals and drums along with energetic vocals uplift the listener into this sense of bliss. This bliss however is quickly turned from a high and mighty feeling, to a much more relaxed feeling with the abrupt and to “Good Will Hunting” followed by “Haldern”, a very slow beginning to a song in which there are only small builds initially with much quieter vocals almost producing this feeling of being defeated. Despite this the song slowly gains bigger and bigger builds throughout its runtime almost generating a building sense of confidence. Up till this point the ups and downs of the vocalists performances effectively emotionally invests the listener in the story of the singer and so making these builds in confidence all that much more rewarding to hear. This is followed by one of the most lugubrious songs on the albums, “Marks Theme”, which begins with a relatively simple saxophone solo until a piano begins to join and the song is instantly imbued with a newfound feeling of hope and happiness yet with a melancholic feeling of longing as the instrumental continually recesses into mournful silences. This is made even more emotional once the context is known that the song is a tribute to the saxophonist’s uncle who passed away. Explaining why the saxophone solo was saturated with so much emotion and melancholy. This transitions into my personal favorite song on the album, “The Place Where He Inserted the Blade”. It begins with a beautiful piano and flute followed by the gorgeous delivery of the vocalist sounding crushed and longing yet hopeful. This hope is built upon from the start reaching a much more elated feeling. This develops into the chorus in which both the instrumentals and vocals are intensely enthusiastic yet morose. Despite the instrumentals relaxing after the chorus, the vocal delivery of lines does not and is still permeates the newfound confidence building yet again into another magnificent chorus with a choir of backing vocals and stunning saxophone really entrenching this feeling evoked by the of bold and dauntless singing. The song then slows to a gradual and slow end almost bittersweet due to how upbeat the runtime of the song is.  The continual bombardment with emotional turmoil throughout the album does not end with the next song “Snow Globes” beginning with gracious instrumentals that evoke more encouraging feelings in the listener than the instrumentals on a song like “Haldern”. Drums are then introduced far in the background of the song slowly being brought forward displaying the genius behind the development of the songs on the albums. Vocals are then later introduced with a sense of lingering sadness yet still feel reassuring as the song slowly builds with fast simbal’s + drums being introduced again lifting the song slowly but surely. This stirring drumming gradually increases to loud frantic drumming in which vocals are then shouted over establishing the sense of the tireless attempts by the singer to escape the depressing hole of emotion he has being trying to escape from throughout each song on the album. Towards the end of the song the instrumentals are then reduced to simple the same simple and gracious repeating instrumentals heard at the beginning of the song which create this feeling that no matter how many times the singer reaches the highs of emotion they will continually return to the same state of melancholic sadness. The final song on the album, “Basketball Shoes” has the longest runtime on the album at a lengthy 12 minutes and 37 seconds. Once again it begins with a gradual build with vocals being introduced sounding broken. Despite this as seen before the music and vocals get progressively more energetic until once again as seen so many times on the album the build reduces to the same blue and moody instrumentals. This leads the listener into the same place as previously on the album expecting a saddening ending to the confidence of the vocals and a depressing end, however the instrumentals, instead of fading to silence, quickly increase faster and faster until switching to an extremely cheery beat. The vocals reintroduced sound new and rejuvenated. Quickly transitioning to energetic shouting vocals and fast lively vocals. Until for one more time quickly being tampered down into a quiet muffled tune sounding almost only just struggling to stay alive on the track. The expectation of a depressing end to the song however is yet again quickly subverted into an extremely loud and abrasive guitar with all instrumentals being introduced at once. This time rather than a gradual build an instant punch of energy absorbs the song slowing and slowing, however this time, rather than dampening down to muffled instruments, loud harsh drums keep the heartbeat of the song going, the vocals quickly latching onto this energy and very quickly building into this larger than life swing with every instrument playing and vocals screaming with one of the most stunning emotional vocal and instrumental performances I’ve ever heard in my life. This energy is kept up with some of the most jubilant sound vocals on the album so far. This confident vocal performance only enhances the listeners’ feeling of being absorbed in exquisite power and rather than tampering out to nothingness this high is the only on the album to end with an exceptional amount of energy and power. This end indicates an almost completion to the vocals constant attempt to get out of this pit of repeating depressive lows as this final song finally ended with aggressive confidence concluding the albums theme and giving the most satisfying ends to an album I’ve ever heard.</p>
